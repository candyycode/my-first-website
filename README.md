 <p><strong>There are three different species of elephant – the African Savannah elephant, the African Forest elephant and the Asian elephant. Elephants are known for their large ears, tusks made of ivory and their trunks. Elephants are the world’s largest land animal! Male African elephants can reach 3m tall and weigh between 4,000 -7,500kg. Asian elephants are slightly smaller, reaching 2.7m tall and weighing 3,000– 6,000kg. The elephant trunk serves as a nose, a hand, an extra foot, a signaling device and a tool for gathering food, siphoning water, dusting, digging and much more. An elephant’s trunk can hold 2.5 gallons of water. The elephant is pregnant for an average of 22 months. On average baby elephants weigh 200 – 300 pounds at birth. Elephants purr like cats do, as a means of communication. They have been known to learn more than 60 commands! </strong>
